Hi There!

I'm Cristian, a current full time student at SAIT in the Software Development program.
I started going to SAIT in Winter 2023, and end the program in Spring 2024.
My interests include games, watching youtube videos, working out, and taking photos some of the time.
I'm hoping to be a game developer at some point, right now I'm just looking at whatever way I can build my skills up towards being a game developer.
If you have any queries feel free to e-mail me at *.
